\title{Cyanotoxin water concentrations in the upper San Francisco Estuary}
\format{
data frame with 719 rows and 11 columns
\describe{
\item{Source}{Name of the source dataset. Is one of the following: CVRWQCB
(Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board), DWR (DWR's State
Water Project), EastBay (East Bay Regional Park District), Nautilus
(Nautilus Data Technologies), Preece (Preliminary results from Preece et
al.), or USGS (Special study by USGS and DWR).}
\item{Station}{Location where sample was collected}
\item{Latitude}{Latitude of \code{Station} in Decimal Degrees (WGS 84 Datum)}
\item{Longitude}{Longitude of \code{Station} in Decimal Degrees (WGS 84 Datum)}
\item{Region}{Region designation of \code{Station} for the Emergency Drought
Barrier analysis. Is one of the following: Cache Slough/Liberty Island,
Clifton Court, Lower Sacramento, Lower San Joaquin, San Joaquin, SDWSC,
South Delta, Upper Sacramento, or Vernalis.}
\item{Year}{Calendar year of the sample}
\item{Month}{Numeric calendar month of the sample where 1 represents
January and 12 represents December}
\item{Date}{Calendar date of the sample in yyyy-mm-dd}
\item{Analyte}{Name of Cyanotoxin measured in the water sample. Is one of
the following: Anabaenopeptins, Anatoxins, Microcystins, or Saxitoxins.}
\item{Result}{Concentration of \code{Analyte} measured in the water sample in
micrograms per liter}
\item{Result_Sign}{A symbol representing whether the Cyanotoxin value in
\code{Result} is below a lower detection limit, equal to the reported value, or
above an upper detection limit. Contains one of three symbols: "ND", "=",
or ">". "ND" indicates that the value was below a lower detection limit.
All values below a lower detection limit in this data set were replaced
with zeros. "=" indicates that the value was detected by the laboratory
with the value in the corresponding \code{Result} column equal to the actual
value measured by the laboratory. ">" indicates that the value was above an
upper detection limit with the with the value in the corresponding \code{Result}
column equal to the upper detection limit.}

\description{
A data set containing Cyanotoxin concentrations in whole-water
grab samples collected at various locations in the upper San Francisco
Estuary (Delta). The majority of the available cyanotoxin data was
collected in 2021, so this data set only includes data from 2021 for all
stations except for Big Break Regional Shoreline. Big Break has a longer
monitoring history, so all data collected at this location from 2015â€“2021
are included in this data set. Used in the analyses for the Spring-Summer
version of the 2022 HABs/Weeds report for the Emergency Drought Barrier.
