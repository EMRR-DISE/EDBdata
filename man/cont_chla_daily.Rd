\description{
A data set containing daily average and median values of
continuous chlorophyll fluorescence data collected by DWR and USGS from
2020-2021 for the stations within the designated Emergency Drought Barrier
(EDB) regions. Used in the analyses for the EDB.

All chlorophyll data collected by DWR_NCRO (DWR's North Central Region
Office) was downloaded from the Water Data Library (WDL). Data collected by
DWR_CEMP (DWR's Continuous Environmental Monitoring Program) was acquired
through direct data requests. And data from USGS were downloaded directly
from the National Water Information System (NWIS) using the \code{dataRetrieval}
R package. Some of the data from USGS is considered provisional.
