An R data package containing data sets used in the Emergency Drought Barrier (EDB) analysis. This data package also contains useful metadata describing the data sets and the processing scripts used to derive the data. 

This package provides the following data tables:

* `hab_sat_ow_delta`: Summary of Cyano Index values derived from HAB satellite data for four open water regions in the upper San Francisco Estuary (Delta): Franks Tract, Mildred Island, Clifton Court Forebay, and Liberty Island. Summary statistics cover the spring through late fall (May-Dec) in 2020 and 2021. Includes averages of Cyano Index for each region and date in addition to pixel counts within 4 Cyano Index categories.
* `phyto_edb`: Phytoplankton community data collected by DWR's Environmental Monitoring Program from 2014-2021 for stations within the Emergency Drought Barrier regions
* `cont_chla_daily`: Daily average and median values of continuous chlorophyll fluorescence measured in the water in-situ at the stations within the Emergency Drought Barrier regions. Data was collected by DWR and USGS from 2020-2021.
* `disc_nutr_chla`: Concentrations of chlorophyll-a and three nutrient parameters (Dissolved Ammonia, Dissolved Nitrate + Nitrite, and Dissolved Ortho-phosphate) in water samples collected at various locations in the Delta east of Chipps Island for 2014-2021
* `hab_toxins`: Cyanotoxin concentrations in whole-water grab samples collected at various locations in the Delta in 2021
* `mc_vis_index_wq`: *Microcystis* visual index, secchi depth, and water temperature data collected at various locations in the Delta from 2007-2021
