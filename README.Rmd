* `phyto_edb`: Phytoplankton community data collected by DWR's Environmental Monitoring Program from 2014-2021 for stations within the Emergency Drought Barrier regions
* `cont_chla_daily`: Daily average and median values of continuous chlorophyll fluorescence data collected by DWR and USGS from 2020-2021 for the stations within the Emergency Drought Barrier regions
